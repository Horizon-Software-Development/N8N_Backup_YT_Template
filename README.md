# ðŸ”„ n8n Template Auto-Backup to GitHub

This repository sets up a GitHub Action that automatically backs up your **n8n workflows** and **credentials** stored in a PostgreSQL database to GitHub on a weekly basis.

Never lose your workflows again â€” everything is version-controlled and safely stored.
